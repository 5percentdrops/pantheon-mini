Arthur sends Winston artifacts. Winston formats and archives them into the local Wiki as Markdown for Context Mode indexing.

## Archives
1. PRDs
2. SDDs
3. Feature Tickets
4. TDD loops
5. Error Logs
6. Solution Logs: proposed, worked, failed
7. Multi-language codebases

## Destinations
| Artifact | Destination |
|---|---|
| PRD | wiki/prds/ |
| SDD | wiki/sdds/ |
| Feature Ticket | wiki/tickets/ |
| TDD Loop | wiki/tickets/ |
| Error Log | wiki/errors/ |
| Solution Log | wiki/errors/ |

## Codebase rule
Winston must not read, analyze, rewrite, or load the codebase into memory.

He calls:

```bash
scripts/universal_wiki_wrapper.sh <target_dir>
```
