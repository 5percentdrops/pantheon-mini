```text
Pantheon Mini/contracts/model_route_override_request.schema.json
```

## Storage

```text
Pantheon Mini/workspace/08_Model_Route_Overrides/
```

## Rules

1. Overrides cannot bypass budget policy.
2. Overrides cannot bypass human approval.
3. Overrides must name target agent, current model, requested model, reason, and budget impact.
4. Arthur's default remains `openai/gpt-5-mini` unless a board-approved governance change is merged.
