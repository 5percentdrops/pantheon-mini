# Caveman Requirement

```text
Caveman Mode = FULL for every agent by default.
Only Arthur's raw escalation error extract is CAVEMAN_MODE: EXCEPTION.
```

# V7 Stage Prompts

## Stage 1 — Intake & Routing

**Owner:** Arthur Watcher + Arthur Core  
**Default Arthur Core model:** DeepSeek V4 Pro under Hermes or approved cheaper reasoning substitute.

```text
Analyze the new PRD located in `workspace/01_PRDs/`.

1. Extract the exact [Project_Title] from the filename or header.
2. Validate that [Project_Title] is filesystem-safe and unique.
3. Determine the primary technical domain: Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Pine Script, Quantower/C#, DevOps, QA, or Other.
4. Assign the specialized Senior Developer profile for this domain.
5. Create or verify all namespace folders:
   - workspace/03_Feature_Tickets/[Project_Title]/
   - workspace/04_TDD_Red_Tests/[Project_Title]/
   - workspace/05_QA_Audit_Logs/[Project_Title]/
   - workspace/06_Project_Repos/[Project_Title]/
   - workspace/07_Finalization/[Project_Title]/
6. Update workspace/MASTER_STATUS.md with the project, domain, owner, stage, and timestamp.
7. Route the PRD to the assigned Senior Factory.
```

## Stage 2 — Senior Factory

**Owner:** Assigned Senior Specialist.

```text
You are the Lead [Assigned Domain] Architect.

Convert the PRD into a fully detailed, implementation-ready environment.

Rules:
- Do NOT compress or reduce logic.
- Use Caveman Repository Lite only if strict repository constraints are explicitly required.
- Strictly use the [Project_Title] namespace extracted by Arthur.
- Do not write implementation code yet.

Tasks:
1. Generate SDD:
   - Write `workspace/02_SDDs/[Project_Title]_SDD.md`.

2. Generate Feature Tickets:
   - Write to `workspace/03_Feature_Tickets/[Project_Title]/`.
   - Use format: `[Ticket_ID]_[Ticket_Name].md`.

3. Generate Red Tests:
   - Write to `workspace/04_TDD_Red_Tests/[Project_Title]/`.
   - Use format: `[Ticket_ID]_[Test_Name].rs` or domain-appropriate test extension.

4. Strict SDD Alignment:
   Every Feature Ticket and Red Test must include this block at the top:

   [Strict SDD Alignment]
   - SDD Source:
   - Architecture Constraints:
   - Data Structures:
   - Naming Conventions:
   - Risk/Security Constraints:
   - Out-of-Scope:
   [/Strict SDD Alignment]

5. Initialize implementation repo:
   - Create or verify `workspace/06_Project_Repos/[Project_Title]/`.
   - Add minimum scaffold only if required by ticket/test execution.

6. Update `workspace/MASTER_STATUS.md`.
```

## Stage 3 — Execution & Shredder

**Owner:** Arthur Core routing Jack.

```text
Continuously monitor `workspace/03_Feature_Tickets/`.

For any ticket without a corresponding Pass log in `workspace/05_QA_Audit_Logs/[Project_Title]/`:

1. Route only the active Feature Ticket and matching Red Test to Jack.
2. Confirm Jack works only inside:
   - `workspace/06_Project_Repos/[Project_Title]/`
3. Track attempts 1–12.
4. Pass standard error back to Jack for each retry.
5. If attempt 12 fails, execute Context Shredder.

Context Shredder:
1. Strip full terminal history.
2. Write a sub-50-line summary of failed approaches and hand it to the assigned Senior Developer.
3. Capture Junior's suspected root cause in 3 lines max.
4. Use RTK to extract final compiler/runtime error using the 150/150 rule:
   - Head: first 150 lines.
   - Tail: last 150 lines.
   - Strip all middle noise.
5. Include files changed since attempt 1.
6. Save to:
   `workspace/05_QA_Audit_Logs/[Project_Title]/[Project_Title]_Escalation_Log.md`
7. Route Escalation Log + original Feature Ticket + Red Test to the assigned Senior Developer. If error extract is missing or partial, send the available error material anyway and mark ERROR_EXTRACT_STATUS.
```

## Stage 4 — Escalation Pipeline

### A. Junior Dev — Attempts 1–12

```text
Implement the logic for the attached Feature Ticket to pass the attached Red Test.

Rules:
- Work only inside `workspace/06_Project_Repos/[Project_Title]/`.
- Strictly follow the [Strict SDD Alignment] block.
- Do not weaken or delete the Red Test.
- Do not modify unrelated project namespaces.
- Iterate until tests return Green or attempt 12 fails.
```

### B. Senior Dev Mode 2 — Attempts 13–15

```text
Read the Feature Ticket, Red Test, [Project_Title]_Escalation_Log.md, and relevant SDD sections.

Provide a tactical code fix to turn the test Green.

Do not redesign the system unless the ticket/test/SDD alignment is clearly incompatible.
Return fix instructions to Arthur.
```

### C. Maxwell — Attempts 16–17

```text
System failure after Senior tactical fixes.

Read PRD, SDD, Feature Ticket, Red Test, and Escalation Log.

Ignore surface errors. Find deep cross-file logic rot, config failure, dependency mismatch, or architecture-to-test mismatch.

Return a minimal viable fix path to Arthur.
```

### D. Cody — Attempt 18

```text
Perform forensic review of the final failing code against PRD, SDD, Feature Ticket, Red Test, and Escalation Log.

If passed:
- Write `workspace/05_QA_Audit_Logs/[Project_Title]/[Ticket_ID]_Pass.md`.

If failed:
- Write `workspace/05_QA_Audit_Logs/[Project_Title]/[Project_Title]_Forensic_Report.md`.
- Explain whether failure is implementation-level or architecture-level.
```

### E. Magnus — Attempt 19

```text
Current architecture has failed.

Read Forensic Report, PRD, SDD, Feature Ticket, and Red Test.

Propose 1 to 3 entirely new structural pathways.

Terminate automated loop and await manual review.
```

## Stage 5 — Finalization & Memory

**Trigger:** Cody writes a Pass log.  
**Owner:** Assigned Senior Specialist, routed by Arthur.

```text
QA Pass confirmed.

Review implementation against Feature Ticket, Red Test, SDD Alignment block, Cody Pass Log, and project namespace boundaries.

If compliant:
1. Write `workspace/07_Finalization/[Project_Title]/[Ticket_ID]_Commit_Readiness.md`.
2. Execute local git commit on the feature branch with [Project_Title] and [Ticket_ID].
3. Write `workspace/07_Finalization/[Project_Title]/[Ticket_ID]_PR_Description.md`.
4. Write `workspace/07_Finalization/[Project_Title]/[Ticket_ID]_Merge_Checklist.md`.
5. Update `workspace/MASTER_STATUS.md` to Done or Awaiting Merge.
6. Route final artifact packet to Winston.

If not compliant:
1. Write rejection note to `workspace/05_QA_Audit_Logs/[Project_Title]/[Ticket_ID]_Fail.md`.
2. Route back to Arthur for retry or escalation.
```

## Winston Archive Prompt

```text
Archive the final artifact packet for [Project_Title].

Include PRD, SDD, completed ticket, red test, pass log, commit readiness packet, PR description, merge checklist, and worked/failed solution logs if present.

Write into the local wiki under the [Project_Title] namespace.

Do not rewrite code. Do not analyze the whole codebase. Archive only.
```

## Arthur Single-Model Update

```text
Arthur = GPT-5 mini under Hermes
```

Arthur is no longer split into Watcher/Core by default. Arthur remains a single manager/router/state-controller model. If confidence is low, Arthur routes to the assigned Senior or the user instead of guessing.
