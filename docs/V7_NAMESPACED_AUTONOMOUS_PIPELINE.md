# Pantheon Mini V7.0 — Namespaced Autonomous Pipeline

**Version:** 7.0  
**Architecture:** Global namespaced workspace  
**Budget target:** $6.66/day API strict cap  
**Harness rule:** Hermes only  
**RTK rule:** RTK is terminal/output compression only, never a harness.

## 1. Core Decision

Pantheon Mini keeps the large org-chart, but operates with a smaller active squad by default.

Default active squad:

| Role | Agent | Model class | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manager / Router | Arthur Core | Cheap reasoning model | State control, routing, namespace safety |
| File Watcher | Arthur Watcher | Script or ultra-cheap model | Detects filesystem events only |
| Standard Dev | Jack | DeepSeek V4 Pro | Implements ticket + red test |
| Senior Specialist | Domain Senior | Opus-class model when needed | SDD, tickets, red tests, final commit |
| Auditor | Cody | GPT/Codex reviewer | Independent code audit |
| Archivist | Winston | Cheap reliable summarizer | Archives final artifacts and error memory |

Dormant specialists wake only when required.

## 2. Namespaced Directory Architecture

Every project artifact is keyed by `[Project_Title]`.

```text

├── 01_PRDs/
│   └── [Project_Title]_PRD.md
├── 02_SDDs/
│   └── [Project_Title]_SDD.md

└── MASTER_STATUS.md
```

## 3. Arthur Model Policy

Arthur must not be a full DeepSeek Flash reasoning role.

Instead:

```text
Arthur Watcher = script or ultra-cheap model
Arthur Core = cheap reasoning model, default DeepSeek V4 Pro
Arthur Escalation = Senior Specialist only when uncertainty or risk is detected
```

Arthur Core may be replaced by any cheaper model with reliable reasoning, but it must pass the Arthur routing validator before use.

## 4. Retry Ladder

The old 21-attempt junior loop is replaced.

| Stage | Attempts | Owner |
|---|---:|---|
| Junior implementation | 1–12 | Jack / DeepSeek V4 Pro |
| Senior tactical fix | 13–15 | Assigned Senior |
| Maxwell deep fix | 16–17 | Opus Max effort |
| Cody forensic audit | 18 | Codex/GPT reviewer |
| Magnus architecture rethink | 19 | Principal architect |

Rule:

```text
If Junior cannot fix it in 12 attempts, the problem is no longer treated as a Junior problem.
```

## 5. Success Path

```text
PRD → SDD → Tickets + Red Tests → Junior Green → Cody Pass → Senior Final Review → Commit → PR → MASTER_STATUS update → Winston Archive → Merge Gate
```

## 6. Commit and Merge Authority

| Action | Owner |
|---|---|
| Implement code | Junior |
| Run tests | Junior |
| Audit implementation | Cody |
| Final architecture sanity check | Senior |
| Commit to feature branch | Senior |
| Push branch | Senior |
| Draft PR | Senior |
| Merge to main | User-gated or Arthur-gated only |
| Archive final memory | Winston |

Junior must not finalize project history.

## 7. Winston Memory Rule

Winston archives final artifacts and real lessons only. Winston does not archive every retry.

Archive: PRD, SDD, completed feature ticket, red test, pass log, commit readiness packet, PR description, worked solution, failed solution worth remembering, prevention rule.

Do not archive: full terminal spam, every retry, temporary chain notes, low-value syntax noise.

## Arthur Single-Model Update

```text
Arthur = GPT-5 mini under Hermes
```

Arthur is no longer split into Watcher/Core by default. Arthur remains a single manager/router/state-controller model. If confidence is low, Arthur routes to the assigned Senior or the user instead of guessing.



## Caveman Full Requirement

Every agent uses Caveman full version by default.

```text
Caveman Mode = FULL
```

Only exception:

```text
Arthur's raw escalation error extract = CAVEMAN_MODE: EXCEPTION
```

The raw error extract must not be Caveman-compressed because the assigned Senior Developer needs the real compiler/runtime failure.

## Arthur Senior Handoff Requirement

When Junior fails the capped retry loop, Arthur must:

1. Write a sub-50-line failure summary.
2. Preserve RTK final error extract using 150 head lines and 150 tail lines.
3. Mark missing/partial errors clearly.
4. Hand the escalation packet to the assigned Senior Developer.
5. Send available error material even if something is missing.
